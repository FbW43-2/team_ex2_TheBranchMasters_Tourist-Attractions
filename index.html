    <h2>Augsburg Attractions (created by Florin )</h2>

    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://augsburg.de">Augsburg</a>
      is the third largest city in Bavaria after Munich and Nuremberg.This
      ancient and famous imperial city was once the home of the two great
      medieval merchant dynasties of the Fuggers and the Welsers and is now the
      chief town of the administrative region of Bavarian Swabia
      (Bayerisch-Schwaben). Once connected with Verona by the Via Claudia, an
      ancient Roman road, Augsburg's favorable location promoted it as a center
      of commerce;

    <p>
      Augsburg Cathedral (Augsburger Dom), a Roman Catholic structure built in
      the 11th century with additional features added later in the 14th century,
      is one of the city's top tourist draws. It's also one of Europe's more
      unusual cathedrals, largely due to its lack of a true fa√ßade, as well as
      its twin choirs;

    <h4>Augsburg Town Hall</h4>
    <p>
      Augsburg Town Hall . In the center of Augsburg stands the old Town Hall
      (Augsburger Rathaus). Completed in 1624, this massive Renaissance building
      is popular as much for its spectacular interior as for its exhibits
      relating to the city's rich and fascinating past;

    <h4>The Perlachturm</h4>
    <p>
      The Perlachturm. If you're able to tackle a 261-step climb, then right
      across from the Town Hall is the equally interesting Perlachturm, a
      10th-century watchtower with commanding views over the city from its
      observation deck;
