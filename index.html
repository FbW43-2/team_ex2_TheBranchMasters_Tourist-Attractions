    <h3>Königsallee: Germany's Most Elegant Avenue</h3>
    <p>
      Düsseldorf's most elegant street, Königsallee — translated into English as
      "King's Avenue" — is affectionately known to locals as the "Kö" and is
      said to be Germany's ritziest shopping district.

    <h3>Rhine Embankment Promenade</h3>
    <p>
      Düsseldorf's Rhine Embankment Promenade (Rheinuferpromenade) offers one of
      the best ways of enjoying the city's wonderful riverside. Opened in 1997
      as a means of hiding one of the city's busiest roads (it's buried beneath
      the promenade), this long pedestrian route gives the city a distinctly
      Mediterranean flavor, lined as it is by cafés, restaurants, galleries, and
      shops on one side, and the mighty Rhine on the other.
