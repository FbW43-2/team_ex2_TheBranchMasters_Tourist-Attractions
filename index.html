    <p>
      Leipzig is one of the most popular tourist destinations in eastern
      Germany, and thanks to its rich cultural and musical heritage, is
      regularly cited as one of the most livable cities in Europe. For tourists,
      it is a very manageable city, with many things to do right in the compact
      Old Town. But however close its attractions, don't think you can spend
      just one day in Leipzig - you will want time to see its excellent museums,
      pause for a concert in one of its churches, and savor the pastries in at
      least one of the coffee houses it is famous for.

    <h3>1. Markt and Old City Hall</h3>

    <p>
      The Markt in Leipzig, for many centuries the hub of city life, is
      dominated by the Old City Hall (Rathaus), a Renaissance building erected
      in 1556 considered one of the most beautiful Renaissance buildings in
      Germany. The tower, with its Baroque crown, is placed asymmetrically over
      the main entrance, above which is a roofed balcony used for public
      proclamations, often involving trumpeters in traditional costumes. The
      colonnades along the front were built in 1907, replacing the wooden shops
      and booths that once stood here, but you'll still find shops under the
      arcade. Inside the Rathaus is a museum filled with artifacts and pictures
      from Leipzig's history, from its medieval fairs to the 1989 "peaceful
      revolution." The large square is the scene of a farmers market, and during
      the city's many music festivals (the annual Bach Festival fills the city's
      churches and concert venues with music each June), it is fitted with a
      stage for performances.

    <h3>2. St. Nicholas Church and the Miracle of Leipzig Monument</h3>

    <p>
      Built in the 12th century, St. Nicholas Church (Nikolaikirche) has been
      altered in various ways over the centuries, the most recent transforming
      its interior into the Neoclassical style in the 1700s. The entire interior
      is white, and its fluted columns rise to capitals from which palm fronds
      seem to spring out and support the groined ceiling. It's a surprising
      flourish to an otherwise Neoclassical interior. Several works by Johann
      Sebastian Bach, who was music director both here and at St. Thomas Church,
      premiered here, and the church's organ is known for being one of the
      finest in Europe.

    <h3>3. Leipzig Zoo</h3>

    <p>
      More than just a day's outing for children, the Leipzig Zoo is among
      Germany's best, where 850 different animal species live in habitats very
      close to their natural homes. Here, you can watch through an underwater
      glass wall as elephants swim, be greeted by the calls of black howler
      monkeys, see penguins play, look for alligators in the murky re-creation
      of the Everglades and find shy koalas lazing in their own eucalyptus
      forest. In tropical environments, meet Germany's only Komodo Dragon - a
      lizard that can grow up to three meters long, drift in a boat through a
      rainforest inhabited by 100 exotic animal species, walk jungle paths, or
      get a bird's-eye view across the lush green canopy from the treetop trail.
      More than 24,000 plants create a tropical environment, where you can also
      see a garden with 60 exotic fruits and spices growing.
